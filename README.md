# neovim-config

Actively updated neovim configuration that is being used by myself

### How to use

1. Find the nvim config locaton on your computer by running `:echo stdpath('config')` in neovim
2. Clone this project to your nvim config folder
3. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) then run `:PlugInstall`
4. Install pyright by `npm i -g pyright` to get python lsp working
5. Install [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation) to get clangd lsp working, as clangd requires compile_commands.json file which is generated by build system to parse the source code, if your build system doesn't support that, please try to use this small script [clangdgen](https://github.com/dwrdx/clangdgen)
6. Install [vscode-json-language-server](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted) by `npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted` to get JSON lsp working
7. Follow [nvim-treesitter quickstart](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#quickstart) to get treesitter installed, NOTE: this step requires a C compiler on your computer
8. Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching
9. Install [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/) for searching
